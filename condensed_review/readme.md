# Condensed Review Materials

For workshop participants that have already completed the Introduction to R course on DataCamp before the workshop, this is a condensed version of the materials in Part 1 and Part 2 of the core lecture materials.  Because this is review, there is a presentation to cover most of the material.  Then a small set of materials to cover via live coding to reinforce a few concepts.

The core exercises Part 1 and 2 can still be used.

[Part 1](https://nuitrcs.github.io/intro_r_workshop/condensed_review/fundamentals_review_part1.html): presentation

[Part 2](https://nuitrcs.github.io/intro_r_workshop/condensed_review/fundamentals_review_part2.html): `data.frame` review, workspace, and packages
